Description: Functions to assist with CPUE standardization. These include
    standLM, plotstand, impactPlot and others. Maps
    and closures can be generated uing the associated package called
    r4maps. The optimum model is now selected via AIC and a warning issued
    if the adj_r2 selects a different factor. In R4.0.0, this now 
    works as intended.
